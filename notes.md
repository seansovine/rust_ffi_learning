## Example project: `skedge`

The `skedge` project that is a submodule of this project
contains some good examples of FFI usage. And, there is a
Reddit post,
[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust/comments/plkjzz/function_pointers_across_ffi_boundary/),
where the project author and commentors debug some problems
with calling a C function pointer through the Rust FFI.
This has been a helpful source to look at.
