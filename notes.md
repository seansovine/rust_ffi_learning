## Example project: `skedge` crate

The [`skedge`](https://github.com/deciduously/skedge) crate contains
some good examples of FFI usage. And, there is a Reddit post,
[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnrust/comments/plkjzz/function_pointers_across_ffi_boundary/),
where the project author and commentors debug some problems
with calling a C function pointer through the Rust FFI.
This has been a helpful source to look at.
